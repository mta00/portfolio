    "### Writing your own k-means clustering algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "K-means clustering is a simple unsupervised machine-learning method for cluster analysis. The aim of the method is to partition a set of points into k clusters, such that each point is assigned to the nearest cluster. The algorithm iterates through two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assign each data point to the cluster with the nearest centroid\n",
    "2. Update the centroids of the clusters given the new assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm converges when the assignments no longer change. Since the intial assignment to clusters is largely random, there is no guarantee that the optimum assignment is found. So it is common to run the algorithm multiple times and use different starting conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will implement a much simplified version of the k-means clustering algorithm. Rather than running the algorithm until convergence, we will repeat the above two steps a large but fixed number of times. In addition, we will initialize only once, using a naive method according to which we randomly choose k points from the data to use as initial cluster centroids. \n",
    "\n",
    "(In real life, you will of course use a library to implement such an algorithm. In Python, you can do this using [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html).)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the assignment, we will additionally use data from the file \"Wholesale customers data.csv\". The file contains information on the annual spending on diverse product categories for the clients of a wholesale distributor. The data are obtained from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) and you can find more information about them [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers#).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "Use docstrings to describe your functions. We will subtract points from your mark if you do not use appropriate description of your code."
